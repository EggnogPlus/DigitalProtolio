        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This is my favourite photo because of how I did it. I have no clue. I know know what I did to it but back when I was fiddling with the settings I had no idea what i was doing or changing when i took this photo but i thought it was amazing and is still my favourite photo out of the entire section</div>

        <div class="lineup">
            <img src="Images/shutter%201.jpg" style="width: 80vh">
        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This is my second favourite photo due to how intresting it is. It isn't common for you to see water flowing but paused to show all the curves you normally can't see due to the speed. When you increase the shutter speed the camera takes a photo faster than lower shutter speeds, showing the image in what it looks like a HD frozen way. (1000 Shutter Speed)</div>

    <h1>Aperture and Shutter Speed</h1>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="lineup">
            <img src="Images/aperature%202.jpg" style="width: 80vh">
        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This photo was taken with a different aperture and different distance away from the camera this as you can see changes the photos quality by a hige amount demonstrating the importance of having the exact right settings for the exact photo you are trying to take. The other Aperture example was shown in my favourite works</div>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="lineup">
            <img src="Images/shutter%202.jpg" style="width: 80vh">
        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This photo is from the same water fountain in my second favourite photo but the difference is that i decreased the shutter speed. This takes photos with the illusion that they are still moving thats why in this photo the water appears like a perfectly shaped tube, and the other looks jagged and more natural. (200 Shutter Speed)</div>

    <h1>ISO</h1>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="lineup">
            <img src="Images/ISO%201.jpg" style="width: 80vh">
        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This is my first photo taken just before adjusting the ISO settings. This photo was taken with the base ISO of 100. The next photo is the same photo but with 400 ISO</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="lineup">
            <img src="Images/ISO%202.jpg" style="width: 80vh">
        </div>
        <div class="lineup">
            <div class="text2">This is the second photo with the ISO setting on 400. I find this intresting due to how light sensitive this setting can change the camera to be. I also find intresting that this option even exist. You could use this at night where it's really dark but there is otehr cameras that do that same thing way better. Just thought of that :P.</div>
