            <div class="text3">This was our first project to make a beating heart. I made three versions of the heart. First was the basic beating heart, then I did a infinitely scrolling heart which was the only one I recorded. The last one i did was a heart that beated like a cascading effect/ ripple effect from the inside out which looked really cool but then didn't record which i regret now. </div>

            <div class="text3">This was my extension project. Making an animation of Pacman running away from a ghost. This involved lots of layyering of images onto the microbit. One of the hardest parts I found was making the Pacman seem to be moving offscreen. Lots of looking back at older pictures then changing pixels slightly, then testing and it just took a while, and if you messed up one pixel it didn't look right and you had to restart which happened a few times. This just took a the biggest part of making the entire thing.</div>
